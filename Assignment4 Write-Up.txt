Assignment 4 Write-Up

I personally think I completed this assignment 95% of the way.  I think I fulfilled the actual 
needs of the programming, but I'm just not sure how much comments I have to include.  I'm not 
going through someone else's work to comment how they did something as complex as writing a 
compiler/assembler/emulator.  I did, however, comment on what I contributedand that may or may 
not be acceptable.  My main problem I had during this assignment was the microcode.  Adding the 
cases to the flex and masm files was pretty straight forward. But when it came to microcode, it 
took me way too long to figure out how the assembler figured out how to get to the correct 
microcode.  I actually ended up turning all the "tir = tir + tir; if n then goto ...;" and 
"alu = tir + tir; if n then goto ....;" statements into "tir = lshift(tir); if n then goto ...;" 
to make it much more consistent and easier to read (at least for me).
